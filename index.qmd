Hi! I’m Erick, a researcher passionate about the genetics of adaptation and co-evolution in humans, primates, and their pathogens. My interest is focused on population genomics and evolutionary dynamics, particularly in populations with admixture histories.

I’m currently a pursuing a PhD in Genetics and Genomics at Duke University in Paul Magwene’s Lab, where I investigate the evolution and population genomics of *Cryptococcus neoformans*. Previously, I worked with Amy Goldberg studying howler monkey population genomics, uncovering patterns of inbreeding and hybridization across four Brazilian species.

My academic journey began with a degree in Genetics from San Marcos University (Peru, 2015), followed by a Master’s in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from Cayetano University (2023). During my master’s, I researched *Plasmodium falciparum* in the Peruvian Amazon under Dionicia Gamboa. I’ve also studied hereditary diseases—from SCA2 ataxia at the Peruvian Neurogenetics Research Center (with Mario Cornejo) to hearing loss in collaboration with Mustafa Tekin (University of Miami), publishing our findings in the journal *Genes*.
