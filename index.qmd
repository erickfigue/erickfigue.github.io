Hi, I'm Erick Figueroa, I'm a researcher interested in population genomics to understand the genetics of adaptation and co-evolution through genome studies of human and non-human primates, as well as their pathogens. I have a particular interest in evolutionary genetics in populations with history of admixture.

I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Genetics and Genomics at Duke University. Before joining the program, I was a research associate at Amy Goldberg's lab, where I analyzed the genome of howler monkeys to identify evidence of inbreeding and hybridization between species.

I got my masters' in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Cayetano Univeristy in Peru, in 2023. For my thesis I did a population genomic analysis of *Plasmodium falciparum* from the Peruvian Amazon to identify evidence of selection. I did this thesis with Dionicia Gamboa in the malaria lab.

I also have worked in genetic of hereditary human diseases as a researcher at the Peruvian neurogenetics research center with Mario Cornejo. There studied the genetics of the ataxia SCA2 and non-syndromic hearing loss. This last work was in collaboration and supervision of Mustafa Tekin from University of Miami, and was published in the journal genes.
