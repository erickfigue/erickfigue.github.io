    "text": "Hi, I’m Erick, I’m a researcher interested in population genomics to understand the genetics of adaptation and co-evolution through genome studies of human and non-human primates, as well as their pathogens. I have a particular interest in evolutionary genetics in populations with history of admixture.\nI’m currently pursuing a PhD in Genetics and Genomics at Duke University. Before joinng the program, I worked as research associate at Amy Goldberg’s lab, analyzing the genome of non-human primates to identify evidence of inbreeding and hybridization between species.\nI got my masters’ in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Cayetano Univeristy in Peru, in 2023. For my thesis I worked in the malaria lab of Dionicia Gamboa, where I performed population genomic analysis of Plasmodium falciparum from the Peruvian Amazon to identify evidence of selection."
