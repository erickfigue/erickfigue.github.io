    "text": "Hi!, I’m Erick Figueroa, a researcher focused on population genomics, with interest in genetics of adaptation, co-evolution in humans, primates and their pathogens. I have a particular interest in evolutionary studies in populations with history of admixture.\nI am currently pursuing a PhD in Genetics and Genomics at Duke University. Previously, I worked at Amy Goldberg’s lab, studying the genomics of howler monkeys, with an emphasis on inbreeding and hybridization. I earned my master’s in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from Cayetano University in Peru (2023), where I analyzed Plasmodium falciparum in the Peruvian Amazon for my thesis, supervised by Dionicia Gamboa. I have also studied hereditary diseases, including ataxia SCA2 at the Peruvian Neurogenetics Research Center with Mario Cornejo, and hearing loss in collaboration with Mustafa Tekin from the University of Miami, with our findings published in the journal Genes."
