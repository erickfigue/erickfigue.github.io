    "text": "My first book review\nAuthor: George R.R. Martin\n\n\n\n\n\nI chose Fevre Dream because some time ago I decided to read more consistently outside of academic and scientific literature. To stay motivated, I began following accounts dedicated to books, reading, and libraries, and that’s how I found the Fevre Dream. A virtual bookstore was offering it, but I couldn’t purchase it at that time. Later during my visit to Peru I went to Quilca’s bookstores in search of new reads to bring back to Durham, and I made sure to looks for Fevre Dream. By then, I had read a brief synopsis, so I wanted to give it a try.\nSet in the 1850s during the abolition of slavery in the U.S., Fevre Dream is a vampire story, although for a moment the nature of these creatures is questioned. However, they are a supernatural species distinct from humans. the Mississippi River itself feels like a character in the novel, with Martin’s vivid description of the steamboats specially the Fevre Dream, and the life of people of the river.\nSince I’m not familiar with this historical settings, I enjoyed that the description was immersive. For the casual reader, the book paints a clear picture of the time and place. The characters, main and secondary, are well-developed, to the point to strongly dislike, or even despise, some of them.\nWithout giving away spoilers, to whoever reads this, I’ll note that the story carries a dark tone with moments of cruel violence and injustice that may unsettle the reader. There are several exciting moments, but the highlights for me were the first revelation of the true nature of one of the main characters, and the first confrontation with the antagonist. The final confrontation is thrilling as well, though it was on uneven conditions, since it took place after a time gap, time gap that left few loose ends. The ending, while was in some way satisfying, it was slightly disappointing because it didn’t let us know if the key motivation of one of the main characters was fulfilled, leaving me with this and other unanswered questions.\nFor my next reading I’m debating between another nove, an essay or maybe a book of history. I’ll try to keep doing this."

I have a particular interest in evolutionary studies in populations with history of admixture.\nI am currently pursuing a PhD in Genetics and Genomics at Duke University. Previously, I worked at Amy Goldberg’s lab, studying the genomics of howler monkeys, with an emphasis on inbreeding and hybridization. I earned my master’s in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from Cayetano University in Peru (2023), where I analyzed Plasmodium falciparum in the Peruvian Amazon for my thesis, supervised by Dionicia Gamboa. I have also studied hereditary diseases, including ataxia SCA2 at the Peruvian Neurogenetics Research Center with Mario Cornejo, and hearing loss in collaboration with Mustafa Tekin from the University of Miami, with our findings published in the journal Genes."
